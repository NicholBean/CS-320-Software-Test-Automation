## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure that my code is functional and secure through rigorous testing. I incorporate different testing techniques such as negative and boundary testing to ensure that my code is functioning and test it once more with the opposite requirements to ensure both the positive and negative statements work as they should.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by analyzing the requirements given by the user and ensure there are tests to correpsond with the requirements. These requirements are my first priority to outline, ensuring that I do not forget specific instructions. Afterwards, I create tests to correspond with the user's requirements to ensure that the code is functioning as it should while also filling their needs.

## How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by analyzing the given requirements and understand what is needed before developing. Once the requirements are outlined, I begin coding them and incorporating corresponding tests to ensure that my code is functioning properly. Once these tests have passed, I like to do the opposite of the given tests to ensure that they fail, understanding that both ways of testing whether an exception has passed because a function has failed or not.
